Figuration was started as an in-house project at [CAST, Inc](http://www.cast.org) based off Bootstrap v.3.

At the time Boostrap did not have the level of accessibility that it does now.  They have made amazing strides in accessibility and usability since then.

Since CAST is a small, nonprofit education research and development organization, our work is mostly funded through grants, some private and some from the U.S. Federal Government.  This requires us to comply to Section 508 laws regarding our web-based research tools, which were not being met by the released versions of Bootstrap at that time.

CAST took a slightly different approach towards adding accessibility to the framework than Bootstrap and their developers.  We decided to embed most of the accessibility functionality into the widgets so it is automatically applied as needed.  This decision allows us to make functionality updates without having to revisit each research project and make individual updates.  Also our small development teams did not have to worry about accessibility if the primary focus was not on the front-end development.
