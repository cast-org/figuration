2. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies.
4. Run `grunt` (or a specific set of Grunt tasks) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
5. From the root `/figuration` directory, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the command line.
6. Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser, and enjoy.
